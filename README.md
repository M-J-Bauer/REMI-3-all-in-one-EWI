# REMI 3 - 'All-in-One' EWI

REMI 3 is an "electronic wind instrument" (EWI) using a fingering scheme based on the recorder. 
This model is fully self-contained, battery-powered with built-in sound synthesizer, audio amplifier and speaker.

Note: GitHub thinks this source code comprises mostly C++ language (95%), probably because it is meant to be compiled under the Arduino IDE, which has many library functions developed in C++. In fact, the REMI 3 application code is composed of 100% pure C-langauge.
