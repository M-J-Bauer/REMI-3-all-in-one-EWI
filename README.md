# REMI 3 - 'All-in-One' EWI

REMI 3 is an electronic musical instrument (EWI) designed as a DIY project for electronics hobbyists.
The instrument is fully self-contained, battery-powered with built-in sound synthesizer, audio amplifier and speaker. 

A complete description can be found in the web-page here:

Note: GitHub thinks this source code comprises mostly C++ language (95%), no doubt because it is compiled under the Arduino IDE with many library functions written in C++. In fact, the REMI application code is composed of 100% pure C-langauge.
