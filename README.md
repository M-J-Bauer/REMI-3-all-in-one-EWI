# REMI 3 - 'All-in-One' EWI

REMI 3 is an "electronic wind instrument" (EWI) using a fingering scheme based on the recorder. 
The instrument is fully self-contained, battery-powered with built-in sound synthesizer, audio amplifier and speaker. 
Designed as a DIY project for electronics hobbyists. A complete description can be found on the web-page here: http://www.mjbauer.biz/REMI_3.htm

Note: GitHub thinks this source code comprises mostly C++ language (95%), no doubt because it is compiled under the Arduino IDE with many library functions written in C++. In fact, the REMI application code is composed of 100% pure C-langauge.
